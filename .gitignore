### CocoaPods ###
## CocoaPods GitIgnore Template

# CocoaPods - Only use to conserve bandwidth / Save time on Pushing
#           - Also handy if you have a large number of dependant pods
#           - AS PER https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html NEVER IGNORE THE LOCK FILE

### fastlane ###
# fastlane - A streamlined workflow tool for Cocoa deployment
# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the
# screenshots whenever they are needed.
# For more information about the recommended setup visit:
# https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/source-control/#source-control

## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
# vendor/Pods/

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/doc/
/rdoc/

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

### Ruby Patch ###
